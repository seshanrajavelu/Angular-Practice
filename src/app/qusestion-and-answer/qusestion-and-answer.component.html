    <div class="answer">
        <h3>Answer:</h3>
        <p>
            Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source framework for building web applications. It is a complete rewrite
            of
            AngularJS and offers enhanced performance, improved modularity, and better tooling support.
        </p>
        <p>
            AngularJS, also known as Angular 1.x, is an older version of Angular that uses JavaScript (ES5) and has a
            different architecture and programming model compared to Angular.

        <h3>Question 3:</h3>
        <p>Explain the Angular component lifecycle hooks and their usage.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
        <h3>Answer:</h3>
        <p>
            Angular provides several lifecycle hooks that allow you to tap into specific moments of a component's
            lifecycle
            and perform certain actions. The most commonly used lifecycle hooks are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>ngOnInit</code>: Called after the component is initialized and the inputs are bound.</li>
            <li><code>ngOnChanges</code>: Called when the input properties of the component change.</li>
            <li><code>ngAfterViewInit</code>: Called after the component's view (and child views) are initialized.</li>
            <li><code>ngOnDestroy</code>: Called just before the component is destroyed and removed from the DOM.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h3>Question 4:</h3>
        <p>What is data binding in Angular? Explain the different types of data binding.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
        <h3>Answer:</h3>
        <p>
            Data binding is a way to establish a connection between the template (HTML) and the component (JavaScript)
            in
            Angular. It allows you to synchronize data between the component and the view.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are three types of data binding in Angular:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Interpolation:</strong>
                It allows you to bind data from the component to the view by using double curly braces {{ propertYName }}.
              </li>
            <li><strong>Property binding:</strong> It allows you to bind a property of a DOM element to a property of
                the component using
                square brackets ([]).</li>
            <li><strong>Event binding:</strong> It allows you to bind an event of a DOM element to a method in the
                component using
                parentheses (()).</li>
            <li><strong>Two-way binding:</strong> It allows you to establish a bidirectional binding between a property
                of the component
                and a form element, so that changes in the component or the view are reflected in both.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h3>Question 5:</h3>
        <p>What are Angular directives? Differentiate between structural and attribute directives.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
        <h3>Answer:</h3>
        <p>
            Angular directives are instructions that allow you to extend the functionality of HTML elements. They can be
            applied as attributes, elements, or class names in the HTML markup.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two types of directives in Angular:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Attribute directives:</strong> They are used to change the appearance or behavior of an element.
                They are
                typically applied as attributes in the HTML markup. Examples include <code>ngStyle</code> and
                <code>ngClass</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Structural directives:</strong> They are used to change the structure of the DOM by adding or
                removing elements.
                They are typically applied as attributes prefixed with an asterisk (*) in the HTML markup. Examples
                include <code>ngIf</code>,
                <code>ngFor</code>, and <code>ngSwitch</code>.
            </li>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Question 7:</h3>
    <p>Explain the concept of modules in Angular.</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>
        In Angular, modules are used to organize the application into cohesive blocks of functionality. A module
        consolidates components, services, directives, and other related code into a single unit. It provides
        encapsulation and modularity, allowing you to manage dependencies and efficiently reuse code.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Question 8:</h3>
    <p>What is dependency injection in Angular? How does it work?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>
        Dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern in which a class receives its dependencies from an external source
        rather than creating them itself. In Angular, DI is used to provide instances of services or other dependencies
        to the components or other classes that require them.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Question 9:</h3>
    <p>How do you handle forms in Angular? Explain template-driven forms and reactive forms.</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>
        In Angular, forms can be handled using two approaches: template-driven forms and reactive forms.
    </p>
    <p>
        Template-driven forms rely on directives in the template to create and manipulate the form controls. The form
        controls are bound to the component's properties using two-way data binding. Validation is done using
        built-in or custom validators defined in the template.
    </p>
    <p>
        Reactive forms, on the other hand, are built programmatically using TypeScript. They offer a more flexible and
        reactive approach to handling forms. Form controls and their validation are defined in the component class,
        and the template binds to these controls using reactive form directives.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Question 10:</h3>
    <p>What are Angular services? How do you create and use services in Angular?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>
        Angular services are singleton objects that provide functionality that can be shared across multiple components
        and modules. They are used to encapsulate business logic, data access, or other operations that are not specific
        to a particular component.
    </p>
    <p>
        To create a service in Angular, you can use the CLI command <code>ng generate service serviceName</code>. This
        will generate a service class that you can implement with the required functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
        To use a service, you need to inject it into the component or other classes that depend on it. This is typically
        done using constructor injection, where you define a parameter of the service type in the constructor of the
        consuming class.

<div class="question">
    <h3>Question 11:</h3>
    <p>How do you handle HTTP requests in Angular? Explain the HttpClient module.</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>
        In Angular, HTTP requests are handled using the <code>HttpClient</code> module, which provides a simplified
        API for making HTTP calls to a server.
    </p>
    <p>
        To use the <code>HttpClient</code> module, you first need to import it into your component or service. Then, you
        can use its methods, such as <code>get()</code>, <code>post()</code>, <code>put()</code>, and
        <code>delete()</code>, to send HTTP requests and receive responses.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>HttpClient</code> module also provides features like request/response interceptors, error handling,
        and support for different data formats, such as JSON and form data.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Question 12:</h3>
    <p>What is routing in Angular? How do you implement routing in an Angular application?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>
        Routing in Angular allows you to navigate between different components or views based on the current URL. It
        enables the creation of single-page applications (SPAs) where different views are loaded dynamically without
        refreshing the entire page.
    </p>
    <p>
        To implement routing in an Angular application, you need to define routes in the <code>RouterModule</code>
        configuration. Each route maps a URL path to a specific component. You can also define route parameters,
        query parameters, and route guards for authentication and authorization.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the template, you can use the <code>routerLink</code> directive to navigate to different routes, and the
        <code>router-outlet</code> directive to display the components associated with the current route.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Question 13:</h3>
    <p>How does Angular handle internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n)?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>
        Angular provides built-in support for internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) to create
        applications that can be translated into multiple languages.
    </p>
    <p>
        To enable i18n in an Angular application, you can mark the translatable text in the templates using the
        <code>i18n</code> attribute and provide translations for different languages using localization files.
    </p>
    <p>
        Angular uses the <code>ng-xi18n</code> tool to extract the translatable text from the templates and generate
        an <code>messages.xlf</code> file that contains the source strings. Translators can then translate these
        strings into different languages using tools like <code>xliffmerge</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        At runtime, Angular uses the <code>@angular/localize</code> module to load the appropriate translations based on
        the user's locale and display the application in the selected language.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Question 14:</h3>
    <p>What is Angular CLI? How is it helpful in Angular development?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>
        Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool that provides a command-line interface for creating,
        managing, and scaffolding Angular projects. It simplifies the development process by automating common tasks,
        such as project setup, component generation, testing, and deployment.
    </p>
    <p>
        With Angular CLI, you can quickly generate the basic structure of an Angular project, including components,
        services, modules, and more. It also offers built-in support for testing with Karma and Protractor, and it
        optimizes the production build for better performance.
    </p>
    <p>
        The CLI provides a set of commands that you can run in the terminal to perform various actions, such as
        creating components, running the development server, building the application, and generating documentation.
        This helps streamline the development workflow and enhances productivity.

    <h3>Question 16:</h3>
    <p>What is Angular template-driven form and how does it work?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>
        Angular template-driven forms are a way to handle form inputs and validation using Angular's built-in
        directives and two-way data binding. In template-driven forms, you define the form structure and validation
        rules directly in the HTML template.
    </p>
    <p>
        The form controls, such as input fields and checkboxes, are bound to properties in the component using
        [(ngModel)] syntax. Angular automatically tracks the state and validation of these controls and provides
        features like error messages, dirty/pristine state, and form submission.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Question 17:</h3>
    <p>What is Angular reactive forms? How are they different from template-driven forms?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>
        Angular reactive forms are a model-driven approach to handling forms in Angular. Unlike template-driven forms,
        reactive forms are built programmatically in the component class using form controls, form groups, and form
        arrays.
    </p>
    <p>
        Reactive forms provide a more flexible and scalable way to handle complex forms with dynamic validation and
        conditional fields. They offer explicit control over form validation and allow for more robust form
        manipulation and data processing.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Question 18:</h3>
    <p>What is Angular module? How do you create a module in Angular?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>
        An Angular module is a mechanism to organize and encapsulate related components, directives, services, and
        other code into cohesive units. It acts as a container for different parts of your application and provides
        dependency management and encapsulation.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can create a module in Angular by using the <code>@NgModule</code> decorator. In the module definition,
        you specify the declarations (components, directives, pipes), imports (other modules), providers (services),
        and exports (components, directives, pipes) for that module.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Question 19:</h3>
    <p>What are Angular guards? How do you implement route guards in Angular?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>
        Angular guards are used to control access to certain routes in an Angular application. They allow you to
        protect routes based on conditions such as authentication, authorization, and data loading.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are four types of route guards in Angular:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>CanActivate:</strong> It decides if a route can be activated or not.</li>
        <li><strong>CanActivateChild:</strong> It decides if the child routes of a route can be activated or not.</li>
        <li><strong>CanDeactivate:</strong> It decides if a route can be deactivated or not (when leaving a route).</li>
        <li><strong>Resolve:</strong> It resolves data before a route is activated.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        To implement route guards, you create a guard class that implements the corresponding interface (e.g.,
        <code>CanActivate</code>) and provide the guard in the routing configuration using the <code>canActivate</code>,
        <code>canActivateChild</code>, <code>canDeactivate</code>, or <code>resolve</code> properties.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Question 20:</h3>
    <p>What is lazy loading in Angular? How do you implement lazy loading?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>
        Lazy loading is a technique in Angular that allows you to load modules and routes on-demand, when they are
        needed, rather than loading everything upfront. This improves the initial loading time of the application and
        reduces the bundle size.
    </p>
    <p>
        To implement lazy loading, you define separate modules for different features or sections of your application.
        Then, you configure the routes to use the corresponding module using the <code>loadChildren</code> property.
        This tells Angular to load the module only when the associated route is accessed.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Question 21:</h3>
    <p>What is Angular testing? How do you write unit tests in Angular?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>
        Angular testing involves writing tests to verify the correctness and functionality of your Angular
        application. It helps catch bugs early, ensure code quality, and provide confidence in the application's
        behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Angular, you can write unit tests using testing frameworks such as Jasmine and tools like Karma. Angular
        provides a testing API and utilities for creating test suites, mocking dependencies, interacting with
        components, and making assertions.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can test components, services, directives, and other Angular artifacts by writing test cases that check
        inputs, outputs, and the expected behavior. The tests can be executed using the Angular CLI command
        <code>ng test</code> or through your preferred testing environment.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Question 22:</h3>
    <p>What is Angular Universal? How does it improve server-side rendering (SSR)?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>
        Angular Universal is a framework for server-side rendering (SSR) of Angular applications. It allows you to
        render Angular components on the server and send the pre-rendered HTML to the client, which improves the
        initial loading speed and enables better search engine optimization (SEO).
    </p>
    <p>
        By pre-rendering the application on the server, Angular Universal reduces the time required for the first
        meaningful paint, as the user receives the pre-rendered HTML immediately. This provides a better user
        experience and ensures that search engines can index the content of the application.
    </p>
    <p>
        Angular Universal works by running the Angular application on the server using Node.js and generating the
        HTML response. The pre-rendered HTML is then sent to the client, where it is hydrated and becomes an
        interactive Angular application.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Question 23:</h3>
    <p>What is Angular DI (Dependency Injection)? How does it work in Angular?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>
        Angular Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern and mechanism for managing the dependencies of your
        application's components and services. It allows you to declare the dependencies of a class and let Angular
        resolve and provide those dependencies automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Angular, DI works by defining providers that specify how to create and provide instances of certain
        classes or values. You can configure DI at the component level or at the module level by providing the
        dependencies in the respective <code>@Component</code> or <code>@NgModule</code> decorators.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a component or service requests a dependency, Angular's injector looks up the dependency's provider and
        creates an instance of the dependency if it has not been created before. The injector then resolves and
        injects all the necessary dependencies recursively, ensuring that the dependencies are available when needed.
    </p>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Question 24:</h3>
    <p>What is Angular ng-template? How is it used?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>
        In Angular, <code>ng-template</code> is a directive that represents an Angular template. It is used as a
        container for holding markup or Angular elements that can be rendered conditionally or dynamically.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>ng-template</code> is often used in conjunction with other directives like <code>ngIf</code> and
        <code>ngFor</code>. It allows you to define a template block that will be conditionally rendered or repeated
        based on certain conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can use the <code>ng-template</code> directive with the <code>ngIf</code> directive to conditionally
        render content, or with the <code>ngFor</code> directive to iterate over a collection and generate multiple
        instances of a template.

    <h3>Question 25:</h3>
    <p>What is RxJS?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>
        RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a library for reactive programming using Observables. It provides
        a set of powerful operators and a flexible API for managing asynchronous data streams and handling events.
    </p>
    <p>
        With RxJS, you can easily create and transform streams of data and react to changes over time. It enables you to
        write clean and declarative code for handling asynchronous operations, such as HTTP requests, user input, and
        event-based interactions.

        Observables are the core building blocks of RxJS. They represent streams of data or events that can be
        observed over time. An Observable emits values or signals, and other parts of the application can subscribe to
        these Observables to receive and react to those values.
    </p>
    <p>
        Observables can emit multiple values asynchronously and can represent various sources of data, such as user
        interactions, timers, HTTP responses, or custom events. They provide a consistent API for handling asynchronous
        operations and enable powerful composition and transformation using operators.

    <h3>Question 27:</h3>
    <p>What are operators in RxJS?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>
        Operators in RxJS are functions that allow you to manipulate and transform Observables. They provide a wide
        range of operations for filtering, mapping, combining, and modifying the data emitted by Observables.
    </p>
    <p>
        Operators can be used to perform various tasks, such as filtering out certain values, transforming data,
        merging multiple Observables, handling errors, and more. They enable you to create complex data flows and
        implement powerful reactive patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
        RxJS provides a rich collection of operators, including <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>,
        <code>mergeMap</code>, <code>reduce</code>, <code>debounceTime</code>, <code>catchError</code>, and many more.
        You can chain and combine these operators to create sophisticated data processing pipelines.

<div class="question">
    <h3>Question 28:</h3>
    <p>How do you handle errors in RxJS?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>
        RxJS provides several operators for handling errors in Observable streams. These operators allow you to catch
        and handle errors gracefully, recover from errors, or propagate the error further in the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some commonly used error handling operators in RxJS include <code>catchError</code>, <code>retry</code>,
        <code>retryWhen</code>, and <code>throwError</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>catchError</code> operator catches errors emitted by an Observable and allows you to return a new
        Observable or a fallback value. This helps to gracefully handle errors and continue the stream with alternative
        data.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>retry</code> operator retries the failed Observable a specified number of times. This can be useful
        when dealing with transient errors or network-related issues.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>retryWhen</code> operator provides more control over when and how to retry the failed Observable. It
        allows you to specify a retry strategy based on certain conditions or delays.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>throwError</code> operator creates an Observable that emits an error immediately. This can be used to
        intentionally raise an error in the stream or handle exceptional cases.

    <h3>Question 29:</h3>
    <p>What are the benefits of using RxJS in Angular?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>
        Using RxJS in Angular offers several benefits:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Reactive programming:</strong> RxJS allows you to write reactive and asynchronous code in a
            declarative and composable manner. It provides a powerful and consistent way to handle complex data flows
            and asynchronous operations.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Efficient data handling:</strong> RxJS enables efficient data handling by providing a wide range of
            operators for transforming, filtering, and combining data streams. It allows you to process and manipulate
            data with ease.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Event handling:</strong> RxJS simplifies event handling by providing operators like
            <code>debounceTime</code>, <code>throttleTime</code>, and <code>switchMap</code>. These operators help in
            handling user interactions, handling form input, and managing API requests efficiently.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>State management:</strong> RxJS can be used for managing application state and sharing data across
            components using Observable streams. It facilitates a reactive approach to state management and reduces the
            need for manual data synchronization.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Testing:</strong> RxJS provides excellent support for testing by allowing you to easily mock and
            test asynchronous operations. The RxJS testing utilities and schedulers make it easier to write unit tests
            for code that involves Observables.
        </li>
    </ul>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Question 30:</h3>
    <p>What is subscribing in Angular and how does it work?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>
        Subscribing in Angular is the process of listening to an Observable stream and receiving values emitted by it.
        When you subscribe to an Observable, you provide a callback function that will be executed whenever a new value
        is emitted.
    </p>
    <p>
        The subscription process involves three main steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Creating an Observable or obtaining it from a service or operator.</li>
        <li>Subscribing to the Observable by calling the <code>subscribe()</code> method and providing a callback
            function to handle emitted values.</li>
        <li>Unsubscribing from the Observable to release resources and prevent memory leaks.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Subscriptions can be stored in variables and later unsubscribed using the <code>unsubscribe()</code> method,
        typically done in the <code>ngOnDestroy()</code> lifecycle hook to ensure cleanup.
    </p>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Question 31:</h3>
    <p>What are Subjects in Angular?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>
        Subjects in Angular are a type of Observable that allows you to multicast values to multiple subscribers. They
        act as both an Observable and an Observer, meaning they can emit values as well as be subscribed to like any
        other Observable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Subjects maintain an internal list of subscribers and push values to all subscribers whenever a new value is
        emitted. This makes them useful for scenarios where you need to share data across different parts of your
        application.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are different types of Subjects available in RxJS, such as <code>Subject</code>, <code>BehaviorSubject</code>,
        <code>ReplaySubject</code>, and <code>AsyncSubject</code>. Each type has specific characteristics and use cases.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Question 32:</h3>
    <p>What is the difference between BehaviorSubject and Subject in Angular?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>
        BehaviorSubject and Subject are both types of Subjects in RxJS, but they have a slight difference in behavior:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Subject:</strong> A Subject starts without an initial value and only emits values to its subscribers
            that are emitted after the subscriber has subscribed. If a subscriber subscribes late, it won't receive
            previously emitted values.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>BehaviorSubject:</strong> A BehaviorSubject, on the other hand, has an initial value and remembers
            the last emitted value. When a new subscriber subscribes to a BehaviorSubject, it immediately emits the
            last emitted value to the subscriber. If no value has been emitted yet, it will emit the initial value.
            After that, it behaves like a regular Subject and emits values to subscribers.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In summary, BehaviorSubject provides immediate access to the last emitted value, making it suitable for
        scenarios where you want new subscribers to receive the most recent value.
    </p>

<div class="question">
    <h3>Question 33:</h3>
    <p>What is a Promise in Angular?</p>
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>
        A Promise in Angular is a built-in JavaScript object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an
        asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It is a way to handle asynchronous tasks and obtain their
        results when they become available.
    </p>
    <p>
        Promises have three states:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Pending:</strong> The initial state of a Promise. It is neither fulfilled nor rejected.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Fulfilled:</strong> The state of a Promise when it successfully completes with a value.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Rejected:</strong> The state of a Promise when it encounters an error or fails to fulfill with a
            value.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Promises are commonly used when working with asynchronous operations, such as making HTTP requests or reading
        data from a database. They provide a cleaner and more readable way to handle asynchronous code compared to
        callback-based approaches.
